<h1> WHO ARE WE<h1>
    <link rel="stylesheet"type="text/css"href="styles.css">   
<p>We currently are a party of one.   I am retired and have been a resident of Allied Gardens for 10 years.  
     I am embarking on what I hope will be a fruitful venture.   I am excited to announce that I will be opening 
     my home to host engaging game sessions. To ensure fairness, players will be selected on a first-come, 
     first-served basis, with a total of eight spots available each week. These delightful gatherings will commence on 
     Thursdays, from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm. While I will be providing light snacks and non-alcoholic beverages, players 
     are also welcome to bring their own treats, although it is not expected of them.</p>

<h1> WHAT IS OUR GOAL</h1>
    <link rel="stylesheet"type="text/css"href="styles.css">   
<p>.Our main objective is to create a safe, welcoming space for seniors to build positive community connections. We 
  aspire to inspire others to become hosts, promoting greater community involvement and personal connections. Our 
  aim is to create new avenues for seniors to expand their social connections in a secure and friendly environment. 
  We are more than happy to assist all participants in learning the fun games offered as part of our endeavor.</p>

<h1> EASY FREE MEMBERSHIP<h1>
    <link rel="stylesheet"type="text/css"href="styles.css">
<p>The guidelines for player membership are refreshingly simple: leave judgment and prejudices behind, agree to steer
         clear of religious or political discussions, and bring your lively and fun-loving self. Our motto is clear: "We are
          not here to solve the world's problems; we are here to momentarily escape from those worries for a few blissful hours." 
          When you submit your email we will contact you and provide the location, time and game chosen for that session.  
          Once you receive the email, please reply indicating your interest and availability and we will respond accordingly.
