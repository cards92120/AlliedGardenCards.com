    <p> This is a <span class="italic"> 
Thank you for taking the time to evaluate this website. As a 75-year-old gentleman, my main goal is to create a platform where fellow seniors can connect, 
foster social interaction, and enjoy mental stimulation. Having personally experienced the joy and entertainment that card and table games can bring,
 I understand their potential to help individuals struggling to engage with others.

    In today's world, seniors face unique challenges, including increased exploitation and a pervasive sense of distrust. 
    With this website, my aspiration is to make a small but meaningful contribution to alleviate these difficulties for this special group of individuals.
    
    Rest assured that any information provided by members or prospective members will be kept strictly confidential and 
    will not be shared or disseminated in any way. The games offered on this platform are purely social, and there will be no monetary member 
    fees or tolerance for any form of gambling from anyone hosting the games.  Thank you for considering joining our community, and I hope that 
    together we can create a warm and welcoming space for seniors to connect and enjoy each other's company through these delightful games.</p> 
    
    <p> Best regards</p>
